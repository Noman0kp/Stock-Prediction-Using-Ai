# Stock-Prediction-Using-Ai
Predicting stock prices is one of the most challenging tasks in finance due to the highly volatile and non-linear nature of financial markets. Prices are influenced by a variety of factors such as company performance, investor sentiment, economic indicators, and global events. These complexities make it difficult to model stock movements using traditional statistical techniques alone.

With advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), more powerful models have emerged that can uncover hidden patterns and trends in historical stock data. Unlike conventional models like linear regression or moving averages, AI-driven approachesâ€”especially deep learning modelsâ€”are capable of learning from vast datasets and providing more accurate and adaptive forecasts.

ðŸ§  About the Project
This project focuses on building and comparing different models for stock price forecasting, including:

Linear Regression

ARIMA

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks

These models are trained using real-world historical stock data, including features such as opening price, closing price, daily highs and lows, and trading volume. The primary goal is to create a system that not only captures short-term price fluctuations but also adapts to broader market trends.

By leveraging AI, this project aims to enhance financial decision-making through precise, data-driven insights.
